		<h2> My life </h2>
			<p> I left my family in Tahiti to study in Paris. It's a radical change of life but I don't regret it at all. Life in Paris is exciting with many new things to discover.</p>

	<div class="card-white">
	<h2> My passions </h2>
		<p> Before I left Tahiti, I did a lot of sailing, even in competition. Since I am in Paris, I have discovered new passions. Indeed, I am more and more interested in rugby, a sport I could not practice in Tahiti. But I am also interested in culture and in the different museums that Paris offers. </p>

	<h2> My studies  </h2>
		<p> As I told you earlier, I study at the IESEG school of management in La Defense. It's a business school in 5 years which offers a multitude of possible outlets. It's also a professional school because every year I have to do an internship in a company. I am currently looking for an internship for next summer. If you have any opportunities, I put the link of my Linkedin below.  </p>
